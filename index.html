      <h1>Church Patronage Trust</h1>
<h2>Why Patrons?</h2>
<p>
Patronage is an historic element in the Church of England carried over from the
pre-Reformation Church. Each parish has a patron who in the event of a vacancy
exercises the right to present a candidate for the benefice of that
parish. Patrons desire, under God, to act in the best interest of the parishes
they represent in order to ensure that right appointments are made in the
parish and the Kingdom of God is established on firm biblical and pastoral
foundations.
</p>

<h2>The Church Patronage Trust</h2>
<p> The Church Patronage Trust, established in 1871, exercises sole patronage
of 64 parishes and joint patronage of 61 parishes. It is one of the larger
evangelical patronage bodies and most of its parishes are located in the
Midlands and South of England. CPT seeks to support the local church and its
work is focussed on strengthening the evangelistic/pastoral ministry exercised
in the parish. Currently there are 4 CPT Trustees and 5 Assessors who work
alongside the Trustees (listed below).</p>

<h2>The Appointment Process</h2>
<div>
<p>
The process of appointment of clergy is best seen as a 'three-legged stool',
involving two parish representatives (lay members of the PCC), the Diocese
(Bishop/Archdeacon) and the Patron. Technically, the Patron nominates, the
parish agree to the nomination and the Bishop institutes. In reality all three
parties openly discuss/interview the candidates and all three parties must
agree to the final decision. <em>We count it a huge privilege to work alongside
Dioceses and parishes in this way.</em>
</p>

<p>
When a vacancy arises in one of the CPT parishes, ideally one of the
Trustees/Assessors/Secretary visits the PCC to explain the appointment process
and the Patron's role. This often occurs at what is termed a Section 12 meeting
when representatives from the Diocese and the Patrons meet with the PCC. At
this meeting the parish profile will be discussed together with the anticipated
time scale for advertising.
</p>

<p>
At CPT we always encourage the advertising of posts followed by short listing
and a day of interviews in the parish. Thus we seek to engage all parties to
discern the mind of God in an open way.
</p>

<h2>Suspension of Presentation</h2>
<p>
If, to use the technical language, 'presentation is suspended' because of the
possibility of pastoral reorganisation involving the parish, then, instead of a
Vicar or Rector being instituted, a 'Priest in Charge' will be
licensed. Although the terms of appointment are different, the Parishioners
will not notice the difference and will view the Minister as their
Vicar/Rector. In this case, we still value the opportunity to adopt the
'three-legged stool' procedure to ensure each party feels fully involved in the
appointment. Following the introduction of 'Common Tenure' has been a reduction
in the number of 'suspensions'. It is important to note the recommendation that
'Common Tenure leaves the rights of Patrons unchanged'.
